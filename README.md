Runner
======

Game made in collaboration with r/Argentina

## Install

[Download the game here](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/14308/Runner.zip)

**Extract and run Runner.exe**

If there are errors then you most likely do not have XNA 4.0 installed.

[Download XNA 4.0 Redistributable](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=27598)

If there are still errors, you may not have .NET installed (rare).

[Download .NET 4](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=17851)

If the game still doesn't run, I have no idea. XNA requirements are pretty low. According to Microsoft:

>To run XNA Framework games on a computer running a Windows operating system, you need a graphics card that supports, at a minimum, Shader Model 1.1 and DirectX 9.0c. We recommend using a graphics card that supports Shader Model 2.0, which is required by some samples and starter kits.

## TODO

Everything!

I'll post requirements soon.

## Why

This is an experiment started by [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/argentina/comments/2bmno4/pixel_art_para_un_videojuego/). I wanted to see if others were willing to help making a videogame, doing art, music or coding. Many people replied. But we still had no specific game idea. So I decided to do a simple infinite runner as a test. If we can get something decent done in a short time, we can start thinking bigger.

## English? In my r/Argentina?

When I'm on my computer I type in English, I think in English, I code in English. I feel weird otherwise. If language is a problem, we'll work something out.

Cuando estoy en la compu escribo, pienso y programo en Ingles. Es raro para mi escribir en castellano. Si el lenguaje es una barrera, hago el esfuerzo y traduzco todo.
